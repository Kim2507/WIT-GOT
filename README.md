# Purpose:
We built a space where young women in tech can find and prepare for their ideal careers by connecting with other women who can help clarify any concerns and share insights.

Essentially we want to build a virtual home for all the freshmen and sophomore women in college where they can explore tech career options, learn from professionals, and build safe communities. From our user research, we found that freshmen and sophomore women want to explore different tech careers and understand the differences between overlapping/associated careers. Secondly, they want to hear from female professionals across different career fields about their day-to-day routine and responsibilities. Lastly, they want to learn and network with other women through a community that makes them feel safe & confident!!

# What makes us unique?

Well firstly, we focus on specific Users: This product focuses specifically on freshman/sophomore women. Our research and survey results have shown that freshman/sophomore women in tech particularly deal with a lack of confidence when it comes to studying CS and pursuing a career in tech. Through this product, we focus on this user group which has been overlooked by our competitors.

Secondly, we know our users: As women studying cs, we are in the unique position of understanding the struggles our targeted users deal with and we can use our own experience to build tools that can help them. For instance, we know that F/S women lack confidence when it comes to finding the right career, and by asking professionals questions like what is the “ Most difficult thing about your job? ”we provide our users with different perspectives and insights on how to boost their confidence and prepare for their dream career. 

In addition, we believe in highlighting all Tech Careers: Many of our users only know of a handful of career options, limiting their ability to find the career that best fits them.
